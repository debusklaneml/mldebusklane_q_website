Teachers play a critical role in successfully implementing
science education reforms in the United States to provide

high-quality science learning opportunities to all stu-
dents. However, the differentiated ways in which

teachers make decisions about their science teaching are
not well understood. This study takes a person-centered
approach by applying latent profile analysis to examine
how cognitive (pedagogical content knowledge) and
motivational (instructional goal orientations, self-efficacy
beliefs, and reform values) characteristics combine to
form science teacher profiles in middle school. Predictors
of profile membership (bachelor's degree, school %FRL)
and both teacher (science instructional practices) and

student (science achievement, engagement, and self-effi-
cacy) outcomes related to the teacher profiles were also

examined. Five science teacher profiles were identified
(severely discouraged but reform oriented, discouraged
but reform oriented, conventional, confident and
mastery oriented, and confident with multiple goal
approaches) that represented unique configurations of
cognitive and motivation characteristics. Additionally,

findings showed that the teacher profiles were signifi-
cantly related to three dimensions of science instruc-
tional practice including communication, discourse, and reasoning. Finally, the teacher profiles were significantly
related to student science achievement and motivational
outcomes. Implications for differentiated approaches to
teacher professional learning and supports for science
instruction are discussed.
