I am a data geek, aviator, father, husband, and one who easily gets lost in figuring out just about anything.

My personal research focuses on writing self-efficacy and feedback, emotional reactivity, working memory, and various other musings such as creativity and intelligence in the student population. I am also deeply interested in unique quantitative methods, mixtures models, measurement design, machine learning, and longitudinal growth.

Currently, most of my work has centered around computational methods of natural language. These include word vector models, topic generation from word embeddings, and automated pipelines to develop such. My current interests/learnings in this space focus on zero-shot classification, transformer models, language inference and lexical prediction.

All opinions my own.
