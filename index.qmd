# Hi There!
Welcome. This is a site that I've put together (with R) to help communicate (and store) many of the things I'm interested in, who I am, and what I do. Thanks for coming. All opinions my own. 

# Who I am: 
I enjoy learning, using data to answer cool questions, and spending time with my family, friends, and dogs. I live in Richmond, Va.

# What I do: 
I am currently a Computational Social Scientist at Gallup where I get to answer cool questions with world data, use fancy statistics, and help build really cool partnerships across DOD, other government agencies, and the public sector.
