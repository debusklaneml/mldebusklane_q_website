    "section": "",
    "text": "Creative thinking shares many characteristics with traditional complex tasks. We investigated whether implicit theories of creativity would affect creative thinking in a way similar to the impact of implicit theories of intelligence on academic tasks. We altered participants’ theories of creativity to be either more incremental or more entity-like. We also examined the impact of working memory (WM) and cognitive load on creative thinking. Cognitive load fully mediated the relationship between implicit theories and creative thinking, with more incremental beliefs linked to lower cognitive load. In addition, cognitive load partially mediated the relationship between WM and creative thinking. Our results support prior research showing that creative thinking draws on cognitive mechanisms similar to those utilized by other complex tasks, but the impact of implicit theories on creative thinking differs from their effect on traditional academic tasks."

This study takes a person-centered approach by applying latent profile analysis to examine how cognitive (pedagogical content knowledge) and motivational (instructional goal orientations, self-efficacy beliefs, and reform values) characteristics combine to form science teacher profiles in middle school.

Five science teacher profiles were identified (severely discouraged but reform oriented, discouraged but reform oriented, conventional, confident and mastery oriented, and confident with multiple goal approaches) that represented unique configurations of cognitive and motivation characteristics. Additionally,\nfindings showed that the teacher profiles were signifi- cantly related to three dimensions of science instruc- tional practice including communication, discourse, and reasoning.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a survey of opportunities to participate (OtP) in science that will allow educators and researchers to closely approximate the types of learning opportunities students have in science classrooms. Additionally, we examined whether and how opportunity gaps in science learning may exist across schools with different socio- economic levels. The OtP in science survey consists of four dimensions that include acquiring foundational knowledge, planning an investigation, conducting an investigation, and using evidence to communicate findings. A total of 1214 middle school students across 8 diverse school districts completed the survey. Tests of reliability, construct validity, measurement invariance, and external validity were conducted using data collected at the beginning and end of the school year. Results showed evidence that the OtP in science survey scores were internally reliable, invariant across school socioeconomic groups across and time points (i.e., lacking systematic biases in responses by group or time point), and externally valid. Given that scores from the survey were reliable and valid indicators of the four dimensions of interest, structural invariance tests were conducted to examine possible differences in OtP in science across schools from high, middle, and low socioeconomic backgrounds. Findings demonstrate specific ways opportunity gaps to learn science manifest in lower income schools. We discuss the implications of these gaps for science instruction, professional development, policy, and diverse students’ interest and achievement in science, and propose several lines of future study."

    "title": "Clarifying an Elusive Construct: a Systematic Review of Writing Attitudes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Although research recognizes that student attitudes toward writing have the poten- tial to influence a variety of writing outcomes, there is no consensus as to what writing attitude signifies. Further, disparities between conceptualizations of writing attitude make the extant literature difficult to reconcile. In the present study, we systematically review writing attitude research published between 1990 and 2017. Our search procedure and quality analysis led to the retention of 46 articles examining the writing attitudes of students and teachers. Relatively few studies (n = 10) provided an explicit definition of writing attitudes. Further, although the authors of many studies (n = 16) conceptualized writing attitude as including a measure of liking/disliking writing, there was considerable variability in both conceptualization and operationalization throughout the literature, with some studies including measures of self- efficacy, perceived value, and other related constructs. Student writing attitudes were measured in a majority of the included studies (n = 33), and teacher writing attitudes were measured in substantially fewer studies (n = 6). Based on the findings of this review, we offer suggestions for researchers making inferences from studies of writing attitudes. Themes of the reviewed literature and implications for future research are also discussed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using a person-centered approach, this study examined science motivation belief (achievement goals and self- efficacy) profiles among middle school students (N = 1443). Three profiles were identified across grades: con- fidently mastery, high all, and low confidence/low mastery. For grades 6 (n = 520) and 7 (n = 307), a fourth profile, indifferent, and for grade 8 (n = 613), two new profiles, low all and performance-driven, were identified at the end of the school year. Results from latent transition analyses showed relatively stable profile membership; 42–89% of students remained in the same profile between time points. Classroom goal structures predicted profile membership and were aligned to students’ personal goal endorsements. Evidence was also found for the asso- ciation between profile and science achievement. Confidently mastery students demonstrated the highest science achievement, whereas performance was lower for all other profiles, with low confidence/low mastery students generally demonstrating the lowest science achievement."

What would be helpful, in the end, is to have each file named after this identification.\nThankfully, the {dplyr} package has made this super simple.\n\niris %>%\n  group_by(Species) %>% # Group by the variable for which you wish to iterate over to create individual files from.\n  group_walk(~ write_xlsx(.x, paste0(\"iris_\", .y$Species, \".xlsx\")), keep = TRUE)\n\n\ngroup_by\nTo walk through this a bit, you’ll notice a simple group_by function that serves to identify which column we wish to not only group our data by, but the one which we’d like to iterate over to make individual files from.\n\n\ngroup_walk (group_map)\nNext, the group_walk function, which is an extension of the group_map series (more info here) that mimics many purrr functions, except through a series of groups… not just a list, df columsn, or some type of nest.\nIdentical to the other walk functions that are used for their ‘side effects’ (think output, not what it returns… ), the group_walk function silently returns the .x argument. We’re interested in what it does, not the data it may produce. Afterall, I just want the output of the function. I plan to dive into this in a future map post in the future… it can be confusing. Nicely, the group_walk function also includes an option to keep the grouping variable through the keep = option that retains the variable in each .x.\nTo wrap this up, the paste0 function serves to meet the second argument requirement for write_xlsx. If you’re not familiar with paste0/paste, it simply combindes all arguments together. In this case, it is simply taking the string prefix “iris_,” each Species, and “.xlsx” and concatenates them.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{l.debusk-lane2020,\n  author = {M.

I tried to follow the Python code thematic plan, while using some of R’s fantastic infix operators to skip a few steps here or there and a bit of recursion. You’ll also note that I also switch all zeros to NAs, to make things a bit easier to code using is.na.\n\nsolve(board)\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]\n [1,]    5    3    4    6    7    8    9    1    2\n [2,]    6    7    2    1    9    5    3    4    8\n [3,]    1    9    8    3    4    2    5    6    7\n [4,]    8    5    9    7    6    1    4    2    3\n [5,]    4    2    6    8    5    3    7    9    1\n [6,]    7    1    3    9    2    4    8    5    6\n [7,]    9    6    1    5    3    7    2    8    4\n [8,]    2    8    7    4    1    9    6    3    5\n [9,]    3    4    5    2    8    6    1    7    9\n\n\nArguably, I’m not a base R coder or programmer.

    "text": "I am a data geek, aviator, father, husband, and one who easily gets lost in figuring out just about anything.\nMy personal research focuses on writing self-efficacy and feedback, emotional reactivity, working memory, and various other musings such as creativity and intelligence in the student population. I am also deeply interested in unique quantitative methods, mixtures models, measurement design, machine learning, and longitudinal growth.\nCurrently, most of my work has centered around computational methods of natural language. These include word vector models, topic generation from word embeddings, and automated pipelines to develop such. My current interests/learnings in this space focus on zero-shot classification, transformer models, language inference and lexical prediction.\nAll opinions my own."

    "text": "This blog post will be the first in a series that will explore how social scientists, or at least those that tend to span across and into more traditional data science, can leverage and employ simulation techniques into their workflow. At the least, this series will introduce the reader to what statistical simulation is, the very basics, and how it can be used to better understand how a variety of statistical methods function across broad data situations.\n\nWhat is statistical simulation and why should you care?\nIn our case, it’s the process of making fake data in a programmatic way.\nFor instance, if I wanted to understand how well a simple linear regression (OLS) functioned across different, often anticipated, data situations, I could simulate those situations (the data) and then compute how well it did.\nUsing that as a simple example, lets do just that:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + x_1\\beta_1 + \\varepsilon\n\\] In its simplest form, some variable \\(x_1\\) is linearly related to \\(y\\) given some constant influence of \\(\\beta_1\\). Said another way,\n\ndata <- rnorm(10000, 2.5)\n\nThere is more to come… this is a work in progress.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{l.debusk-lane2023,\n  author = {M.
