This study takes a person-centered approach by applying latent profile analysis to examine how cognitive (pedagogical content knowledge) and motivational (instructional goal orientations, self-efficacy beliefs, and reform values) characteristics combine to form science teacher profiles in middle school. Predictors of profile membership (bachelor’s degree, school %FRL) and both teacher (science instructional practices) and\nstudent (science achievement, engagement, and self-effi- cacy) outcomes related to the teacher profiles were also\nexamined. Five science teacher profiles were identified (severely discouraged but reform oriented, discouraged but reform oriented, conventional, confident and mastery oriented, and confident with multiple goal approaches) that represented unique configurations of cognitive and motivation characteristics. Additionally,\nfindings showed that the teacher profiles were signifi- cantly related to three dimensions of science instruc- tional practice including communication, discourse, and reasoning. Finally, the teacher profiles were significantly related to student science achievement and motivational outcomes. Implications for differentiated approaches to teacher professional learning and supports for science instruction are discussed.”"

    "text": "Using a person-centered approach, this study examined science motivation belief (achievement goals and self- efficacy) profiles among middle school students (N = 1443). Three profiles were identified across grades: con- fidently mastery, high all, and low confidence/low mastery. For grades 6 (n = 520) and 7 (n = 307), a fourth profile, indifferent, and for grade 8 (n = 613), two new profiles, low all and performance-driven, were identified at the end of the school year. Results from latent transition analyses showed relatively stable profile membership; 42–89% of students remained in the same profile between time points. Classroom goal structures predicted profile membership and were aligned to students’ personal goal endorsements. Evidence was also found for the asso- ciation between profile and science achievement. Confidently mastery students demonstrated the highest science achievement, whereas performance was lower for all other profiles, with low confidence/low mastery students generally demonstrating the lowest science achievement."

What would be helpful, in the end, is to have each file named after this identification.\nThankfully, the {dplyr} package has made this super simple.\n\niris %>%\n  group_by(Species) %>% # Group by the variable for which you wish to iterate over to create individual files from.\n  group_walk(~ write_xlsx(.x, paste0(\"iris_\", .y$Species, \".xlsx\")), keep = TRUE)\n\n\ngroup_by\nTo walk through this a bit, you’ll notice a simple group_by function that serves to identify which column we wish to not only group our data by, but the one which we’d like to iterate over to make individual files from.\n\n\ngroup_walk (group_map)\nNext, the group_walk function, which is an extension of the group_map series (more info here) that mimics many purrr functions, except through a series of groups… not just a list, df columsn, or some type of nest.\nIdentical to the other walk functions that are used for their ‘side effects’ (think output, not what it returns… ), the group_walk function silently returns the .x argument. We’re interested in what it does, not the data it may produce. Afterall, I just want the output of the function. I plan to dive into this in a future map post in the future… it can be confusing. Nicely, the group_walk function also includes an option to keep the grouping variable through the keep = option that retains the variable in each .x.\nTo wrap this up, the paste0 function serves to meet the second argument requirement for write_xlsx. If you’re not familiar with paste0/paste, it simply combindes all arguments together. In this case, it is simply taking the string prefix “iris_,” each Species, and “.xlsx” and concatenates them.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{l.debusk-lane2020,\n  author = {M.

I tried to follow the Python code thematic plan, while using some of R’s fantastic infix operators to skip a few steps here or there and a bit of recursion. You’ll also note that I also switch all zeros to NAs, to make things a bit easier to code using is.na.\n\nsolve(board)\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]\n [1,]    5    3    4    6    7    8    9    1    2\n [2,]    6    7    2    1    9    5    3    4    8\n [3,]    1    9    8    3    4    2    5    6    7\n [4,]    8    5    9    7    6    1    4    2    3\n [5,]    4    2    6    8    5    3    7    9    1\n [6,]    7    1    3    9    2    4    8    5    6\n [7,]    9    6    1    5    3    7    2    8    4\n [8,]    2    8    7    4    1    9    6    3    5\n [9,]    3    4    5    2    8    6    1    7    9\n\n\nArguably, I’m not a base R coder or programmer.
